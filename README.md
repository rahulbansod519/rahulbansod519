I’m Rahul, an early-career software engineer with a strong interest in backend systems, developer tools, and cloud-native infrastructure.

I’ve built tools like kube-sec, a Python-based CLI for Kubernetes security auditing, and contributed to open-source projects like Kedro. I've also worked with companies like Catchpoint and Red Hat, where I focused on system reliability and OpenShift-based deployments.

My goal is to work with teams solving high-impact engineering problems — building systems that are fast, reliable, and secure.

I enjoy writing clean, scalable code, contributing to open source, and learning through real-world challenges. Right now, I’m leveling up in Go and designing a new open-source project to simplify Kubernetes visibility
